## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌎 Real-Time Weather Data

* Fetches live weather updates (temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, etc.) for any location using API requests.
* Supports **unit toggling** between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F).
* Displays air quality index (AQI) and provides **health-based recommendations**.

### 🧠 AI Weather Assistant

* A built-in **AI chatbot** that interacts with users to:

  * Explain current weather in natural language.
  * Predict upcoming weather conditions.
  * Suggest activities, clothing, or health precautions based on weather patterns.
  * Analyze mood and energy index influenced by temperature, humidity, and air quality.

### 📊 AI Analytics Dashboard

* Uses **Chart.js** to visualize:

  * Hourly temperature changes.
  * Seasonal and monthly weather trends.
  * Pie chart breakdowns for humidity, cloud, and wind data.
  * AI-powered prediction chart using **TensorFlow.js** (ML model placeholder).

### 🗺️ Interactive Map (Leaflet.js)

* Displays live geographical weather data on an interactive OpenStreetMap.
* Dynamically adds markers based on user searches.

### ⚠️ Smart Weather Alerts

* AI detects and displays **severe weather alerts** (storms, heavy rain, heatwaves).
* Beautiful animated alert banners with glassmorphism effects.

### 📰 AI-Curated Weather News

* Fetches and displays latest **weather-related news** for the user’s searched city.
* Uses AI tagging to highlight relevant trends or environmental alerts.

### 💬 Advanced UI/UX

* **Glassmorphism & Neon Glow Design** — built entirely in CSS with smooth transitions.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Search** — Type a city name and click “Search”.
2. **API Fetch** — Axios retrieves real-time weather and forecast data.
3. **AI Processing** — TensorFlow.js and logic analyze:

   * Temperature patterns
   * Air quality and humidity
   * Mood, energy, and productivity levels
4. **Visualization** — Results displayed as:

   * Weather cards
   * AI chatbot insights
   * Interactive map
   * Dynamic charts
5. **User Interaction** — Change themes, toggle temperature units, and chat with the AI assistant.
